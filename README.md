# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview

Using APIs to pull weather and locations data, we built an app that allows users to set desired weather parameters for vacation planning.<br>

# Methology
Using CitiPy a list of random cities was generated.  Using OpenWeater API, we were able to associate weather statistics for user input to constrain their preferences for vacation destinations.<br>

Google Maps API was then integrated to pull through city and accomodation data to generate potential lodging in those locations.  The routing features within the Google Maps API allowed plotting logical itineraries for potential trips.
